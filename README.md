# GitHub Finder

Simple project to get used to using fetch with ES7 async/await. Gets profile and repo data from GitHub based on a search query.

Nothing too special here, but if you really want to use it feel free. Just copy env.json.example to env.json with your own API credentials.

For the love of God do NOT deploy this thing to a public-facing server. Even though I've put the API credentials in an uncommitted file they could still be seen in the browser console. This was a learning project, not something intended for public use.
